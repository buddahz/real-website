	     <center>  	 <p class="editable">Increasingly, in today's society, we are becoming accustomed to the comforts of the modern world. Ordering pizza over the phone or shopping online is already part of the everyday life of 21st Century Man. But then why not extend this concept to everything else? From the small family restaurant that does not have its own delivery service to the friend who forgot the wallet at home, everyone has something in common ... the lack of a small freight transport network that is simple, convenient and affordable to all. The service options provided by any parcel carrier currently on the market do not provide a solution for deliveries from point A to point B, without the customer having to travel to a branch and waiting days for their order to reach the recipient after walking around the city in the box of a minivan. What if there was a solution where the customer would just have to move to his door, wait minutes and still not contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases?</p></center>

    <center>  <h5 class="editable">The Solution....</h5></center>  	
   <center> <p class="editable">It was against this status quo that GreenPackage was born. Derived from the need for a decentralized and peer-to-peer delivery service in which the customer has control over all the steps of the delivery process using the live-tracking system, being able to feel always assured of the well-being of your order. This project also aims to have an ecological impact, offering an alternative to the use of motor vehicles, favoring the use of the bicycle.</br>
                
                 The main business objectives are:</br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; The elimination of delivery / collection points passing the orders to be made from any point A to point B.</br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ease of access to any type of customer through smartphone, tablet or personal computer.</br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; Provide geographic information about your order to customers</br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp;Create a platform that allows you to form a messenger network within zones of a metropolitan            area, reducing the response time to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each order</br>

			<p class="editable">There’s a security risk on our couriers and their cargo. Clients never have access to their location and the couriers will be able to report emergencies through their app window.
                Also in case a package isn’t deliverable by any reason, the client will be
                informed and it will be delivered in the nearest trade post to the receiving
                address.</br>
                Other than the real world problems there’s the need to keep the platform stable
                and safe and even if problems do appear, the platform should be able to keep
                working by not needing to be connected all the time to the main server to
                deliver the current packages.</p>
